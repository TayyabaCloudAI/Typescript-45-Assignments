// Q20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let languages:string[] = ["Arabic", "Italian", "French", "Urdu"]

console.log("LIST OF LANGUAGES");
for(let i=0; i<languages.length; i++)
    {console.log(languages[i])};
