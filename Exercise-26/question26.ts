// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

let alien_color:string = "Purple"

// Printing the if statement
if (alien_color=="Purple")
    {console.log("Congratz! The player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");}
else {console.log("Congratz! The player just earned 10 points for shooting the alien.");}
// Printing the else statement
if(alien_color!=="Purple")
    {console.log("Congratz! The player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");}
else {console.log("Congratz! The player just earned 10 points for shooting the alien.");}
